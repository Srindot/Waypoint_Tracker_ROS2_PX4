# EC4.402: Introduction to UAV Design - Assignment II (Spring 2025)

## **Objectives**

The purpose of this assignment is to apply fundamental principles of **quadrotor dynamics and control** to determine the necessary acceleration inputs and perform flight simulations in  **ROS** . The key objectives include:

### **Q1. Acceleration Input Calculation (Python-Based Plotting)**

- Compute the required acceleration inputs (axd, ayd, azd) for a quadrotor to navigate between the given waypoints using Python.

- Consider a mass of 2 kg and assume a yaw angle Ïˆ = 0Â°.

- Utilize inner-loop attitude control, ensuring perfect tracking of the desired roll (Ï†d) and pitch (Î¸d).

- Generate Python-based plots for:

- Acceleration (ax, ay, az) vs. time

- Desired roll (Ï†d), pitch (Î¸d), and thrust (Td)

- Velocity and position evolution in all three axes

### **Q2. ROS-Based UAV Simulation (PX4, Gazebo, Harmonic, ROS2 Humble, QGroundControl)**

* Implement a **ROS2 Humble-based simulation** to demonstrate quadrotor waypoint navigation using:
  * **PX4 Autopilot** for flight control.
  * **Gazebo Harmonic** for high-fidelity UAV simulation.
  * **QGroundControl (QGC)** for mission planning and monitoring.
* Simulate the quadrotor's motion toward each waypoint while logging  **position, velocity, and acceleration** .
* Generate **Python-based plots** to visualize flight dynamics, ensuring consistency with **Q.1 results**

### 3D Trajectory Plot of Quadrotor Navigation

This plot represents the **quadrotor's movement in 3D space**as it navigates through predefined waypoints. The simulation is based on the  **North-East-Down (NED) coordinate system** , illustrating changes in position over time.**
